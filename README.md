# HealthcareRisk
This is a Pretraining task 1.

Scenario: Predict patient readmission risk and alert doctors early.

Task Requirement: The email specifies predicting patient readmission risk, meaning the target should indicate whether a patient is readmitted (e.g., 1) or not (e.g., 0) after a hospital stay.
Requirements:

Problem Identification: High readmission, delayed intervention, manual monitoring

Solution Design:

Data Collection: Patient records, lab results, vitals (AWS S3 / Azure Blob)

Preprocessing: Missing values, normalization

Model: Random Forest / XGBoost

Cloud Services: AWS SageMaker / Azure ML, RDS / Firestore database

Deployment: Flask or Streamlit API dashboard

Monitoring: CloudWatch / Stackdriver alerts
Deliverables:
